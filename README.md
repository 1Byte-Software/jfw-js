## Getting started

### Installation

Before you start, make sure you have a fresh version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point.

    npm install jfw-js

After installing the jfw-js module using npm, you'll need to bundle it up along with all of its dependencies, or import it using:

    import jfw-js from 'jfw-js'
